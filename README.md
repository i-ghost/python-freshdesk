# python-freshdesk

This is a fork with the purpose of extending the API. **Consider it unstable.**

**TODO**:
* Extend Ticket API to allow modifications
* Add support for ["Forum Post" API](http://freshdesk.com/api#create_post) (Are these any different from models.Post?/api.topics.get_topic().posts?)
* Add support for ["Forum Category" API](http://freshdesk.com/api#forum-category)

Anything below this line is subject to change.
***
A library for the [Freshdesk](http://freshdesk.com/) helpdesk system for Python 2.7 and 3.

Currently it only supports the following API features:

* Getting and modifying a [Topic](http://freshdesk.com/api#forum-topic)
* Getting a [Ticket](http://freshdesk.com/api#view_a_ticket) and filtering ticket lists
* Getting a [Contact/User](http://freshdesk.com/api#view_user)

## Installation

The easiest way to install is from [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-freshdesk) inside a virtualenv:

1. Create the virtualenv (Python 3!) and activate it:

   ```
   $ virtualenv -p python3 cool_app
   $ cd cool_app && source bin/activate
   ```

2. Install from PyPi:

   ```
   $ pip install python-freshdesk
   ```

3. Optionally, run the test suite:

   ```
   $ pip install nose
   $ nosetests
   ```

## Usage

Please note the domain and API key are not real and the example will not work
without changing these.

```python
>>> from freshdesk.api import API
>>> a = API('company.freshdesk.com', 'q8dnkjaS554Aol21dmnas9d92')
```

The `API` class provides access to all the methods exposed by the Freshdesk API.

### Tickets

The Ticket API is accessed by using the methods assigned to the `a.tickets`
instance. Tickets are loaded as instances of the `freshdesk.models.Ticket`
class, and can be iterated over:

```python
>>> a.tickets.list_open_tickets()
[<Ticket 'New ticket'>, <Ticket 'Some tests should be created'>, <Ticket 'Library needs to be uploaded to PyPi'>]
>>> a.tickets.list_deleted_tickets()
[<Ticket 'This is a sample ticket'>]
```

To see which attributes were loaded for a ticket:

```python
>>> ticket = a.tickets.get_ticket(4)
>>> repr(ticket)
"<Ticket 'I keep typing Freskdesk instead of Freshdesk!>"
>>> ticket._keys
set([u'status', u'source_name', u'ticket_type', u'updated_at', ...])
```

Attributes are automatically converted to native Python objects where appropriate:

```python
>>> a.tickets.list_open_tickets()[0].created_at
datetime.datetime(2014, 12, 5, 14, 7, 44)
```

Or converted from indexes to their descriptions:

```python
>>> ticket.priority
'medium'
>>> ticket.status
'closed'
>>> ticket.source
'phone'
```

Viewing comments on a ticket are as simple as looking at the `Ticket.comments` list:

```python
>>> ticket.comments
[<Comment for <Ticket 'Some tests should be created'>>]
>>> ticket.comments[0]
'We could use Travis CI'
```

The original comment (called "description" in Freshdesk) is available on the `Ticket` instance:

```python
>>> ticket.description
'nose is a good suite'
```

### Contacts/Users

Freshdesk mixes up the naming of contacts and users, depending on whether they are an agent or not.
`python-freshdesk` simply calls them all contacts and are represented as `Contact` instances:

```python
>>> repr(a.contacts.get_contact('1234'))
"<Contact 'Rachel'>"
```
